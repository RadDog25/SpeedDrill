# SpeedDrill

(https://raddog25.github.io/SpeedDrill/)

SpeedDrill is a math application suitable for children or those looking to brush up on basic arithmetic! The focus of the game is to answer each question correctly in the target time! If competition mode is selected, the user can compete for the highscore!

SpeedDrill is totally responsive and is designed to be user friendly on any device and work with any modern browser.

This project uses ES6, React, Redux, Bootstrap, and SCSS, and communicates RESTfully with a Python / Django backend (https://github.com/RadDog25/SpeedDrillAPI).

The test folder contains tests for rendering of the App and the 'getNumbers' function that contains the App's critical logic.
